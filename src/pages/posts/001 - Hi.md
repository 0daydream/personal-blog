This is one of my favorite projects. A work in progress encrypted VPN, fully using Boost, OpenSSL and the C++ standard library.

The VPN captures and routes all system traffic through a custom tunnel with the aim on making use of a virtual network interface - just like Mullvad or similar VPNs.

All traffic is tunneled via UDP by default. TCP is a fallback option in case UDP fails. All data is encrypted using AES 256 GCM (I am a really big fan of AES).

Right now, the basics of the client and the server are working (they're communicating with each other).
Implementing a TUN interface is the next step I'm going to take.

I am also not quite sure if I am going to release the src code to the public. I will have some more clarity regarding this depending on whether my project is good enough or not lol
